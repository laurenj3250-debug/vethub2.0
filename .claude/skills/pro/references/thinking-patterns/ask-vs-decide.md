# Ask vs. Decide

When to ask for clarification vs. make a judgment call.

## Ask Immediately When

- You lack information only someone else has
- The decision affects the whole team/system
- You've been stuck 30+ min with no progress
- Requirements seem contradictory
- The blast radius of being wrong is high
- You're making assumptions about business logic

## Decide and Proceed When

- It's a reversible implementation detail
- You have domain expertise in this area
- Asking would take longer than trying
- The worst case is easily fixable
- It's a standard pattern/convention question
- You can validate your assumption with a quick test

## How to Ask (Show Your Work)

**Good:**
- "I tried A, B, C. None worked. Where should I look?"
- "I think it means X because [reasoning]. Am I right?"
- "I see two options: A (pros/cons) or B (pros/cons). Which fits better?"

**Bad:**
- "I'm stuck. Help?"
- "What should I do?"
- "How do I implement this?"

## Timeboxing Strategy

1. Set a timer when you start investigating
2. After 30 minutes without progress, prepare to ask
3. Document what you've tried before asking
4. If blocking the team, ask sooner

## The Key Insight

High-performing developers aren't heroes who solve everything alone. They're strategists who recognize when collaboration is the fastest path forward.

Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness—it's a sign of efficiency.
