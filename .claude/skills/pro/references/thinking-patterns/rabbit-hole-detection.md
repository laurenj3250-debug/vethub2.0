# Rabbit Hole Detection

Recognize when you're going too deep and recover.

## Warning Signs

1. **Aimless Divergence**
   - Reading library source code "to understand it better" without a concrete problem
   - Exploring tangentially related code paths
   - "Just one more file..."

2. **Ego Activation**
   - Solving feels like an affront to your competence
   - "I should be able to figure this out"
   - Refusing to ask for help because you "almost have it"

3. **Diminishing Returns**
   - 2+ hours invested with no closer understanding of root cause
   - Each new discovery raises more questions than it answers
   - Your explanation of what you're doing sounds increasingly convoluted

4. **Scope Creep Within Scope**
   - "While I'm here, I could also optimize..."
   - "This would be cleaner if I also refactored..."
   - Original task forgotten

5. **Complexity Spiral**
   - Solution getting more complex, not simpler
   - Adding more layers to "fix" previous attempts
   - Can't explain what you're doing in simple terms

## Recovery Protocol

1. **STOP** - Literally step away from keyboard
2. **BREAK** - 10-minute walk, different context
3. **ASSESS** - Ask yourself:
   - "If I dive deeper, what specific thing am I trying to learn?"
   - "Is this learning necessary for THIS task?"
   - "What's the simplest thing that could work?"
4. **DECIDE** - If no clear answer, back out and try different approach

## Strategic Evaluation

Some rabbit holes ARE worth exploring (building expertise). The key is making that decision consciously:

**Worth It:**
- Core technology you'll use repeatedly
- Security/reliability concern that must be understood
- Bug that will recur if not understood

**Not Worth It:**
- Edge case that affects 0.1% of users
- "Interesting" but not relevant to task
- Optimization that won't be noticed

## The Trap

Tunnel vision feels like productivity. You're "working hard."

But effort without direction is just spinning wheels.
