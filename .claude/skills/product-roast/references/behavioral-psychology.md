# Behavioral Psychology Principles for Product Design

This reference contains the psychology principles that make products sticky, engaging, and delightful. Use these to diagnose problems and envision solutions.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Habit Loop (Charles Duhigg)

**Structure**: Cue → Routine → Reward

**How it works**:
- **Cue**: Trigger that initiates the behavior (time, location, emotional state, other people, preceding action)
- **Routine**: The behavior itself
- **Reward**: The benefit that reinforces the loop

**Product Application**:
- Identify what cues users to open your app
- Make the routine as frictionless as possible
- Ensure the reward is immediate and satisfying
- Design the cue into daily life (notifications at consistent times)

**Example**: Duolingo
- Cue: Push notification at 9am + streak anxiety
- Routine: Complete one lesson
- Reward: XP, streak continuation, feeling of progress

**Questions to ask**:
- What's the cue to open our app? Is it strong enough?
- Is the routine (core action) too long or confusing?
- Is the reward immediate? Variable? Satisfying?

### 2. The Hook Model (Nir Eyal)

**Structure**: Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment

**How it works**:
- **Trigger**: External (notification, email) or Internal (emotion, habit)
- **Action**: Simplest behavior in anticipation of reward
- **Variable Reward**: Unpredictable positive reinforcement (3 types below)
- **Investment**: User puts something in that improves next experience

**Variable Reward Types**:
1. **Rewards of the Tribe** (social validation) - likes, comments, followers
2. **Rewards of the Hunt** (resources, information) - feed refresh, search results
3. **Rewards of the Self** (mastery, completion) - leveling up, achievements

**Product Application**:
- Move from external triggers to internal (build habits)
- Reduce friction in the action (one tap, not five)
- Make rewards variable, not predictable (random celebrations, different content)
- Create investment that makes leaving costly (data, customization, social graph)

**Example**: Instagram
- Trigger: Boredom (internal) + notification (external)
- Action: Open app, scroll
- Variable Reward: Never know what you'll see next (hunt + tribe)
- Investment: Posts, followers, following relationships

### 3. Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)

**The Three Needs**: Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness

**Autonomy**: Feeling of control and choice
- Let users customize, set their own goals, choose their path
- Avoid forcing users through linear flows
- Provide options, not mandates

**Competence**: Feeling of mastery and growth
- Show progress clearly
- Provide appropriate challenge (not too easy, not too hard)
- Celebrate achievements
- Make learning visible

**Relatedness**: Feeling of connection with others
- Enable sharing, collaboration, comparison
- Show that others are doing this too
- Create community, even if async

**Product Application**:
- Does user feel in control? (autonomy)
- Does user feel like they're improving? (competence)
- Does user feel connected to others? (relatedness)

**Warning Signs**:
- Forced flows, no customization → autonomy violation
- No progress indication, too hard/easy → competence violation
- Isolated experience, no social proof → relatedness violation

## Motivation & Behavior Principles

### 4. Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)

**Principle**: Losses hurt ~2x as much as equivalent gains feel good.

**Product Application**:
- Frame things as losses, not gains: "Don't lose your 45-day streak!" > "Keep your streak going!"
- Make abandonment feel costly (show what they'll lose)
- Streak mechanics leverage this powerfully
- "You've earned X, don't let it go to waste"

**Ethical Note**: Use carefully. Excessive loss framing creates anxiety and resentment.

**Example**: Duolingo's streak freeze
- Costs gems (investment)
- Prevents devastating loss (loss aversion)
- Creates safety net that paradoxically increases engagement

---

### 5. The Endowed Progress Effect

**Principle**: People are more motivated to complete a goal when they feel they've already made progress.

**Research**: Car wash study - 8/10 stamps vs 0/8 stamps. Same work required, but 8/10 framing doubled completion rate.

**Product Application**:
- Start progress bars at >0%
- "You're already 20% done with onboarding!"
- Show past accomplishments as foundation for current goal
- Pre-populate forms with inferred data

**Example**: LinkedIn profile completion
- Shows profile "strength" starting at some percentage
- Breaks down what's missing in small pieces
- Each addition shows immediate progress

---

### 6. Goal Gradient Effect

**Principle**: Effort increases as you get closer to the goal.

**Research**: Coffee loyalty cards - people buy more frequently as they approach the free coffee.

**Product Application**:
- Show proximity to next milestone clearly
- Create intermediate milestones for long journeys
- Make the last 10% feel exciting, not exhausting
- "You're so close!" messaging near completion

**Example**: Habit tracker showing "3 more days until 30-day badge"
- Accelerates behavior as goal approaches
- Creates natural finish-line sprints

---

### 7. Implementation Intentions (Peter Gollwitzer)

**Principle**: "When X happens, I will do Y" dramatically increases follow-through.

**Research**: Planning when/where/how increases goal completion by 2-3x.

**Product Application**:
- Ask users to specify when they'll do the habit
- "I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]"
- Send reminders based on stated intention
- Link habits to existing routines (habit stacking)

**Example**: Habit apps that ask "When do you want to do this?"
- Time-based triggers tied to intention
- Location-based reminders
- "After I brush my teeth, I will meditate"

---

### 8. Commitment & Consistency (Cialdini)

**Principle**: Once people commit to something, they feel pressure to act consistently with that commitment.

**Product Application**:
- Get small commitments before big asks
- Make goals public (increases commitment)
- Written > verbal > mental commitments
- Remind users of their stated commitments

**Example**: Accountability partners in habit apps
- Public commitment to friend
- Social pressure for consistency
- Harder to quit when others are watching

---

### 9. Temptation Bundling (Katy Milkman)

**Principle**: Pairing something you want to do with something you should do.

**Research**: People exercised 50% more when audiobooks were only available at the gym.

**Product Application**:
- Bundle rewards with desired behaviors
- "Only unlock this content after completing X"
- Make the "should" behavior the gateway to the "want"
- Leverage existing guilty pleasures as rewards

**Example**: Only allowing social feed access after logging habits
- Want: See friends' updates
- Should: Log today's progress
- Bundle: Feed unlocked after logging

---

### 10. Fresh Start Effect

**Principle**: Temporal landmarks (new year, birthday, Monday) increase goal pursuit.

**Research**: Gym attendance spikes after temporal landmarks.

**Product Application**:
- Leverage Mondays, month starts, birthdays, anniversaries
- "New week, fresh start" reframe after streak breaks
- Don't punish failure on special days
- Create artificial fresh starts after setbacks

**Example**: "Your streak ended, but tomorrow is Monday - perfect time for a fresh start!"
- Reduces sting of failure
- Provides hope and re-entry point
- Leverages natural temporal landmarks

---

## Cognitive Principles

### 11. Cognitive Load Theory

**Principle**: Working memory is limited. Overload causes abandonment.

**Product Application**:
- Reduce choices (Hick's Law: more choices = slower decisions)
- Progressive disclosure (show only what's needed now)
- Chunk information (7±2 items max)
- Use recognition over recall (show options, don't make users remember)

**Warning Signs**:
- Forms with 10+ fields
- Menus with 15+ items
- Dashboards with 20+ metrics
- Onboarding that asks everything upfront

---

### 12. Zeigarnik Effect

**Principle**: Incomplete tasks stay in memory better than complete ones.

**Product Application**:
- Leave tasks slightly incomplete to bring users back
- "You have 1 unfinished..." notifications
- Progress indicators that show incompleteness
- Don't let users fully "finish" (always show next goal)

**Example**: LinkedIn's "You haven't posted in 3 weeks"
- Triggers memory of incomplete intention
- Creates open loop that needs closing

---

### 13. Peak-End Rule

**Principle**: Experiences are judged by their peak (best/worst moment) and end, not average.

**Product Application**:
- Create memorable positive peaks (celebrations, surprises)
- End sessions on a high note (not a failure)
- If there must be pain, front-load it
- Make the last interaction delightful

**Example**: Duolingo's celebration animation
- Peak: Confetti, encouraging message
- End: "You're on fire! See you tomorrow"
- Memory: Positive, wanting to return

---

### 14. IKEA Effect

**Principle**: People value things they helped create more than equivalent things made by others.

**Research**: People valued self-assembled IKEA furniture higher than pre-assembled.

**Product Application**:
- Let users customize and create
- Show what they've built over time
- Make setup feel like creation, not configuration
- User-generated content, personal data visualizations

**Example**: Habit tracker showing "You've logged 847 entries over 18 months"
- Their data, their history
- Can't get this elsewhere
- Switching cost = losing their creation

---

### 15. Social Proof (Cialdini)

**Principle**: People look to others to determine correct behavior.

**Product Application**:
- Show what similar users do ("People like you typically...")
- Display social metrics (users, completions, ratings)
- Testimonials from relatable people
- "X people completed this habit today"

**Example**: "12,847 people completed their morning routine today"
- I'm not alone
- This is normal behavior
- Others are doing it, I should too

---

## Gamification Principles (Done Right)

### 16. Meaningful Progression

**Anti-pattern**: Badges for everything, meaningless points, arbitrary levels.

**Better pattern**: Progression that reflects real skill or commitment growth.

**Product Application**:
- Points should measure something real (consistency, quality, quantity)
- Levels should unlock meaningful capabilities
- Badges should commemorate real achievements
- Show progression that matters, not just numbers going up

**Example**: Good
- "30-day streak" badge = real commitment demonstrated
- "Early bird" badge = identified user behavior pattern
- Level-ups unlock customization options

**Example**: Bad
- "First login" badge
- "Viewed settings" achievement
- Points that can't be spent

---

### 17. Variable Ratio Reinforcement

**Principle**: Unpredictable rewards are more engaging than predictable ones.

**Research**: Slot machines are more addictive than salary jobs.

**Product Application**:
- Random bonus rewards
- Surprise celebrations
- Loot box mechanics (ethically)
- "Sometimes" rewards beat "always" rewards

**Example**: Occasional confetti burst vs. always showing confetti
- Unpredictability increases engagement
- Brain seeks the dopamine of "maybe"

**Ethical Note**: Powerful. Use for good, not exploitation.

---

### 18. Clear Goals with Progress Feedback

**Principle**: Specific, measurable goals with real-time feedback drive behavior.

**Product Application**:
- Don't just track, show the goal
- Real-time feedback on progress
- Make completion visible
- "You're 7/10 done today"

**Example**: Progress ring showing daily completion
- Clear goal (complete the ring)
- Real-time feedback (ring fills as you go)
- Visible completion (full ring = done)

---

## Application to Specific App Types

### For Habit Trackers

**Key principles to apply**:
1. Habit Loop - design the cue carefully
2. Loss Aversion - streak mechanics
3. Goal Gradient - show proximity to milestones
4. Implementation Intentions - ask when/where
5. Fresh Start Effect - recovery from broken streaks
6. Peak-End Rule - celebrate completions beautifully

**The Streak Dilemma**:
- Streaks work via loss aversion + consistency
- BUT broken streaks cause abandonment
- SOLUTION: Streak freeze (Duolingo), streak repair (partial credit), fresh start framing

### For Clinical Apps

**Key principles to apply**:
1. Cognitive Load - reduce friction in high-stress moments
2. Recognition over Recall - show options, don't require memory
3. Autonomy - let clinicians customize workflows
4. Competence - make them feel efficient, not frustrated

**The Efficiency Imperative**:
- Every extra click = frustration in 15-hour shift
- Information architecture is life or death
- Quick actions > nested menus
- Glanceable status > detailed views
