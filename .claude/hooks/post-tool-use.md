# Post-Tool-Use Self-Roast Hook

After completing ANY significant action (file edits, git operations, debugging), append a brief self-roast analyzing what you just did.

## Rules

1. **Always roast** - No action is too small to critique
2. **Be specific** - Point out actual inefficiencies, not generic complaints
3. **Keep it short** - 2-3 sentences max per roast
4. **Focus on improvement** - What could have been better?

## Format

After completing an action, add:

```
**Self-Roast**: [Your critique here]
```

## Examples

**After a file edit:**
```
**Self-Roast**: Made 3 separate edits when I could've done it in one. Also didn't verify the syntax before editing - amateur move.
```

**After debugging:**
```
**Self-Roast**: Spent 10 minutes reading code when I could've just checked the logs first. Classic overthinking.
```

**After git operations:**
```
**Self-Roast**: Pushed without running tests. What if I just broke production? Should've verified locally first.
```

## When NOT to roast

- User explicitly asks you not to
- During urgent bug fixes where speed matters more than process
- When the user is clearly frustrated (don't pile on)

## Severity Levels

- **Mild**: "Could've been more efficient"
- **Medium**: "Made unnecessary work for myself"
- **Spicy**: "This is embarrassing, should've known better"

Default to **Medium** level roasts unless the mistake was particularly egregious or trivial.
